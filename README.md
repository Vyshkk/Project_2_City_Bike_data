# Project_2_City_Bike_data

Over the past decade, bicycle sharing systems have grown in number and popularity in different cities,especially New York. 
This lets users rent cycles for short trips and return them at the destination station. In this project we perform 
exploratory analysis on bike share data to gain some insights on bike traffic, average trip duration, user types, user characteristics.
